> **Where 3D Body Scanning meets Generative AI Training.**

ScanFlow is a next-generation fitness ecosystem that ingests **3D Body Scans** (Digital Twins) to generate **hyper-personalized** training and nutrition plans using **Google Vertex AI**. Built with a **modular architecture** to support future integrations (Strava, Apple Health, etc.).

---

## ⚡️ Key Features

*   **🧘‍♂️ Digital Twin Engine**: Ingests .obj scans and extracts biometric data (BMR, Body Fat %, Segmental Lean Mass).
*   **🧠 Gemini AI Brain**: Generates weekly workout cycles based on *actual* body composition, not just weight.
*   **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Features (Nutrition, Trainer) are independent plugins. Enable/Disable what you need.
*   **🔄 Adaptive Feedback Loops**: The AI "learns" from your pain reports and cheat meals, adjusting plans in real-time.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Flutter (Mobile - iOS/Android) *[Deferred]*
*   **Backend**: Firebase (Cloud Functions v2, Firestore, Auth)
*   **AI**: Google Vertex AI (Gemini Pro)
*   **Testing**: Local Emulator Suite (No Cloud Bill!)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   Java (JDK 11+ for Emulators)
*   Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tayyipcanbay/scanflow.git
cd scanflow

# Install Backend Dependencies
cd functions && npm install
cd ../scripts && npm install
```

### 2. Run the Live Environment (Emulators)
We use the **Firebase Emulator Suite** to run the entire backend locally. No GCP account required.

```bash
# In Project Root
npx firebase emulators:start --project=demo-scanflow
```
*Wait until you see "All emulators ready".*

### 3. Verify the System
Want to see the AI in action? Run our **Headless Client Script**. It simulates a full user journey (Sign Up -> Upload Scan -> Generate Plan -> Report Injury).

```bash
# In a new terminal window
cd scripts
npm test
```
